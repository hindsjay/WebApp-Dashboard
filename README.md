# Treehouse Techdegree - Project 7 - WebApp Dashboard

Using the mockup provided (dashboard.png) we were tasked with creating a web dashboard that included all the elements shown in the mockup.  

One of the main focuses for this project was CSS grid and we were required to use this for the overall layout of the dashboard.  HTML, CSS, and JavaScript were created from scratch.  The chart functionality was implemented using a JavaScript library called chart.js.  

Highlights of the features for this project:
- Dashboard is responsive and responsive design considerations were made when building out the project
- A drop-down window (notifications) is shown when the bell icon is clicked
- Clicking on the notification "x" will close out that notification
- An alert banner is shown and when "x" is clicked the banner is removed
- Clicking on the traffic chart timelines update the chart with timeframe specific data
- There is no backend functionality but if you click on the send button for messaging a user, an alert is shown if the message was sent successfully or if any one of the fields is left blank
- A jQuery plugin was used for the autocomplete function (user search in the message user section)
- Local storage is used to remember the settings and timezone selected (in the settings section)
